# Contributing guidelines

Welcome!

Before sending your pull requests, make sure that you **read the whole guidelines**. If you have any doubt on the contributing guide, please feel free to ask us
on othe Discussions tab.

#### Coding Style

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

- Please focus hard on naming of functions, classes, and variables. Help your reader by using **descriptive names** that can help you to remove redundant comments.

#### Other points to remember while submitting your work:

- **We won't be accepting any README edits in the form of PRs.**
- Please avoid creating new directories if at all possible. Try to fit your work into the existing directory structure. If you want to. Please contact us on the Discussions tab.
- If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
- If you have modified/added documentation work, ensure your language is concise and contains no grammar errors.
- Do not update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.

Happy Coding :)
